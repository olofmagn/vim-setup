Welcome to my Vim configuration repository! ðŸŽ‰ 
## Features
- Plugin Management: Configured with `Vundle` for easier management.
- Syntax Highlighting: Syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages.
- Code Completion: Seamless code completion with `YouCompleteMe`.
- Themes: Pre-configured themes for an aesthetic coding environment.
- Custom Keybindings: Simplified and efficient key mappings for better usability.

1. Install Cmake, Vim and Python:
```
sudo apt install build-essential cmake vim-nox python3-dev
